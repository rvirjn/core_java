Accessing elements are faster with ArrayList, because it is index based. 
But accessing is difficult with LinkedList. It is slow access.
 This is to access any element, you need to navigate through the elements one by one.
  But insertion and deletion is much faster with LinkedList, because if you know the node,
   just change the pointers before or after nodes. Insertion and deletion is slow with ArrayList,
    this is because, during these operations ArrayList need to adjust the indexes according to deletion or insetion 
    if you are performing on middle indexes. Means, an ArrayList having 10 elements, if you are inserting at index 5, 
    then you need to shift the indexes above 5 to one more. -
